# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We will meet every week at least once, maybe more depending on the progress of the project and everybodies prior commitments and workload. These meetings will be held at HERE apartments room 703 and will last approximately 1-2 hours. During this time we will be assigning work that needs to be accomplished asynchronously and communicate about each individuals progress throughout the week. 
2. **Assistance** 

    We have already created a groupchat to discuss all issues and streamline communication for this final project. Every one of us checks our phones regularly and will be expected to respond in an appropriate time frame. 

3. **Respect** 

    In our team meetings we will ensure that everybody feels welcome and a member of this group by allowing each person to explain what they have worked on this week and allow for questioning after they have expressed their thoughts and concerns for the week. This will ensure that everybody understands what is going on in this project and feels comfortable openly sharing their ideas. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    Workload will be distributed based on the strong suites of the members. We have some who feel a lot more comfortable reading and understanding assembly code than others and will have them work more on the conceptual and object oriented side of the programming. The other two will be mainly focused on using what is built by the members to develop efficient graph algorithms. However if one part of the assignment becomes an unfair amount of workload assigned to one member, these issues will be found and discussed in our team meetings. From there, we will find a fair and equal way to share and redivide work.     

5. **Time Commitment** 

    Each member of this group will be expected to work 4-5 hours a week at a minimum but will be expected to be able to work more if challenges arise or deadlines are not being met. We have discussed prior time commitments and have a general grasp of everybodys schedule and expectations. Once again, the time commitments are flexible because we are expecting them to change as we continue working on this project. These concerns will be tackled weekly in our team meeting and will be discussed and resolved there. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    Conflicts will be found in our team meetings and will be dealt with within that time frame. We will all keep ourselves accountable and laziness and lack of care for this final project will be addressed in our meeting. We understand that everybody here is a student and exams and courseload catches up to you sometimes so those issues will be handled with a more relaxed resolution. Those who fall behind because of work or other reasons will be expected to extend their time commitments and catch up with the rest of us that week. However for larger issues, they will be addressed and talked through with the rest of the members. In the worst case, course staff will be informed and they will be dealt with through them, but we hope to resolve these issues in our weekly meeting, should they arise.
